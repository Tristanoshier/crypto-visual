    // if we are going to do all time data or anything more than a year really, we are going to need to filter the amount of data that comes back, one thought I have is to limit data to 1 day per month for anything more than a year. I think even the years data looks clutttered so maybe only doing two weeks a month would be best giving us 26 dates in the graph.
